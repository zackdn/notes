- been working out for 6 months
- no definitive outcomes
	- Then: “I’ll work out for a few weeks. I’m prob gonna see huge results!”
	- Now: “This is going to take years!!! Enjoy the journey.”
- Focus on what’s fun now
	- Learning new things
		- How bulking/cutting works
		- Body mechanics
		- How protein, carbs, and fats are used by the body
		- Deloading!
	- Experimenting
		- Calories per day vs weight gain
		- Which exercises feel best?
		- What meal prep strategies work for me?
			- Grilling vs baking chicken 
		- What proteins work with my body?
			- Casein vs whey
			- Chicken vs turkey vs beef
	- Getting to know my body
	- Getting slightly better every day
	- Learning new things as part of problem solving 
- Hard stuff
	- When I make no progress
	- When I have to take breaks
	-
