Habit-building is much more compelling for me when I focus on:
- the fun of learning some incremental new thing today
- the pride of seeing incremental improvements
- the thrill of experiencing that day's work
- the serenity of knowing I can enjoy today without the pressure of quickly attaining some lofty goal - today IS the goal
