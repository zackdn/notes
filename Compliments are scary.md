Kate recently complimented me about my parenting and it made me feel unsafe!

I knew that if I internalized it it would feel so good. It would fill a hole I feel inside. It would help make me feel whole. It would make me feel like there was hope for me - that I was a good man. That someone believed in me.

But that made me afraid.

If I let her fill that hole inside of me then one day she might leave and invalidate all those good feelings and affirmations.
