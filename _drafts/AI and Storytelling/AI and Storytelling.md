%% I want a story to start this off with %%

I’ve been playing a lot lately with various LLMs and “AI-powered” tools. I’ve used ==Superwhisper== for helping me record meeting notes. I’ve asked ==ChatGPT== to synthesize large PDFs and data tables. I’ve used ==Snipd== to generate “highlights” of specific segments of podcasts as I listen to them. It’s all been pretty fun, but I find myself asking, “Why”.

It’s really interesting: normally, if I looked at the pile of notes I’ve generated over the past week I’d be really proud of myself for having been so “productive”. Now that these notes were all generated by AI, I’m less impressed. In fact, now I’m asking what to DO with all of these notes - a question I don’t think I’ve given much thought to in the past since I was too excited about the volume of content I’d produced.
