How large language models work

> **How large language models work**
>
> Below is the simplified algorithm that shows how LLMs work:
>
> - The model receives a text as input.
> - The model tries to generate the most suitable next word. 
> - After that, the generated word is added to the initial text and fed back to the model. Again, the model tries to generate the most suitable next word.
> - And so on.
>
> […]
>
> The LLM uses this process to create the “meaningful continuation” of the original input. To the user, the answer looks coherent. But in reality, the LLM does not truly “understand” the text — it simply predicts the next word.
>
> The remarkable property of LLM is that by solving the task of predicting the next word, the model tries to capture the complex structure of language. Because of this, a person using the model might feel like the model “understands” the text.
>
> […]
>
> **Framework for choosing problems that can be solved by LLMs**
>
> To determine whether LLMs are suitable for a certain problem, ask the following question: 
>
> “Can an intern who has recently graduated from university solve the problem using detailed instructions?”
>
> If yes, then experiment with LLMs. 
>
> Andrew Ng provides more information on this framework in his course “[Generative AI for Everyone](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-for-everyone/)”.
