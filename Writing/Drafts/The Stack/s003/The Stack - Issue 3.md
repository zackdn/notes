Death slowly...

---

This week was a bit rough for me and I didn't get a ton of reading done, but I think you're really going to like this issue anyway!

## This Week's Finds

**[Positive Affirmations for Site Reliability Engineers](https://youtu.be/ia8Q51ouA_s)**

Mindfulness is important for everyone! LOL, I nearly peed the first time I watched this parody clip. Maybe take a potty break before watching üòú

[**A morte devagar**](https://www.revistaprosaversoearte.com/morte-devagar-martha-medeiros/)

> A poem by Martha Medeiros

So, I actually read this poem some time ago in the product description for a [kick-ass t-shirt](https://www.gofastdontdie.com/products/slow-death-tee-1). The shirt has a snail version of the grim reaper with text that reads "COMFORT IS A SLOW DEATH" (it's amazing üêåüíÄ).

The point? Take risks. Try new things.

Live.

**Your.**

**LIFE.**

Anyway, the poem came to mind again this week during a conversation with two very close friends of mine. One of them was sharing the fear and doubt he had been dealing with lately since founding his new tech startup.

"Did I make the wrong decision?"

"Was this a bad move for my family?"

"Can I handle this???"

This guy is such an inspiration to me and I'm always so proud of him, so it tore me up to hear the pain and doubt in his voice. That's when I remembered the poem.

He was doing the hard work of pursuing his dream, making something from nothing, trying something no one else had. His life is beautiful! I got the chance to remind him of that.

I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I want to live that kind of life. I want to surround myself with folks that live like that. I want to live my life open and raw enough that those beautiful people I've surrounded myself with can see good in me when I can't.

I refuse to die slowly. How about you?
