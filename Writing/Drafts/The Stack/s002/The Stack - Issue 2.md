Monroe, Michigan; anesthesia and hand-washing; and a little something wonderful

I am having so much fun with this format! The hardest thing is figuring how to whittle down what I want to share with you all.

So, this week I'll keep things a little shorter and see how that feels. Let dig in...

## This Week's Finds

[Only in Monroe](https://youtu.be/voAzz7hRuVE)

> A video with Stephen Colbert

This is an older interview I stumbled across. Stephen and his guest talk about rap music, whether the artist has even been "feat-ed", and Stephen evens encourages the man to consider pursuing a "real" career.

The interviewee's name is Marshall Mathers.

[Sharing Slow Ideas](https://readwise.io/reader/shared/01h49ds7kym6spcff9qy3bpcp2)

> An article by Atul Gawande

This New Yorker article had many stories that were powerful and compelling, but here's the rub: real change doesn't happen until we change people's norms, and those norms don't change outside of the context of relationships.

Technology in and of itself will **never** replace the power of ==social connection== and ==trust==.

## Further Reading

[Read Something Wonderful](https://readsomethingwonderful.com/)

This site is run by the folks behind the [Matter](https://hq.getmatter.com/) read-it-later app. Those guys are doing a bunch of really great stuff, but this project is just so different and refreshing that I had to share.

Here's how they describe the site:

> We spend most of our time building reading software, but we made this site because we felt something was off in the modern media environment. You probably feel it too.
>
> We're referring to novelty bias, the way our feeds and headlines are tuned to show us what's new, not what's best.
>
> Most of the best writing was not created in the past year. Yet most of what we get served is from the past 24 hours. We're stuck in a cycle of ephemeral content consumption, what David Perell calls the "Never-Ending Now."
>
> This site is intended to be a counterweight to the Never-Ending Now, an access point to writing that has stood the test of time.
