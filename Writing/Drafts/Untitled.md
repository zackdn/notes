Oh my goodness, my brain is fried. Today just felt really weird. I started off my quote-unquote workday actually by spending a bunch of time trying to record a video for my newsletter, which I feel it was a bad idea. It really stressed me out. It took a long time like two hours and that was time that I should have spent doing work that I'm behind on. For some reason I really wanted to do it but it kind of sucked all the fun out of it, which is my new like goal for the newsletter. So a little frustrating. But I think what I'm realizing is that when it comes to the newsletter stuff I just want to find like big chunks of time where I can like go away and just have fun doing it without feeling pressure like time pressure, stress that the kids are gonna interrupt it. Like I just got to find a way to make this like a retreat type of experience. It's just a lot more fun that way and that's I really want to keep my focus on this newsletter being fun, like a fun creative outlet. Things feel weird with Jeff and I because basically there's just so much drama between like him and the claims team because he kind of forced them to commit to this March date but Victor's working like nights and weekends to try and keep up and he's getting stressed out and burned out. But I don't feel like I can tell Jeff that because otherwise he'll like get involved and want to like cut more things but they're already cutting so many things. I just want him to like lay off. I feel like the team has earned like trust and respect and we shouldn't have to like I don't know play these games of bureaucracy with dates and stuff. So I asked for some advice back on Friday with some folks and I don't like the L&R's business side and they're really encouraging but they basically just said like hey if you guys have issues like just push the date back and let people know. We'll put it as yellow and it won't be a big deal. So it was helpful but I told them like don't like let's not let this leave this conversation because I'm just trying to like get advice right now I'm not like saying anything is set in stone. Well apparently one of them went and talked to Jeff and he reached out to me and was kind of cagey about it like hey I had a weird conversation what's what's going on and so things just felt weird with him and I today we're gonna talk next week I guess and I think I just need to spend the weekend feeling angry at him about the state of things with the claims project and kind of get it out of my system and processed so that come Monday or Tuesday when we do talk I mean we're gonna get past the emotion of it and just be really blunt respectful but blunt and just say like look man this is this is bullshit like the team has worked their asses off and they deserve to have us just get off their backs and let them do their fucking jobs so they will tell you when they're gonna be done and you and Bruce can fall in line period so anyway I had a call with him and some other folks and just felt awkward and uncomfortable for me because I knew like there's tension there that's unresolved went to group it was really good I was a little scary cuz Parker kind of today you know I actually brought you guys in I wanted to tell you some news and moving to Missouri so I thought that was gonna mean like no more Parker but he said he's still gonna do like zoom so I was scared at first but totally cool and honestly I'm really proud and inspired by him because they're leaving their friends and a really great support system here to move within my walking distance of his sister brother-in-law and their kids because Parker's parents are gonna be moving to the same area and he and his wife are just being really intentional they want to build a life where their son can have access to his cousins and grandparents and just loving family you know community but it's a big risk for Parker because like his sister doesn't really have community or a support system there so he's really giving up a lot to make this work so it's kind of a big gamble but it's a really intentional step to craft the kind of life that he and his wife want and I'm just I'm really inspired by that I I want to live like that I think I kind of highlighted something I've been wrestling with this week and that I feel like there's so many factors in my life that I'm realizing dictate my life to me instead of me controlling my life so thanks one of my motion mood swings stuff like if I don't take my adderall first thing in the morning I can be really grumpy and grouchy and I can sleep way in and I don't like work pressures like this subconscious pressure I feel to like work hard so that people know that I work hard and like I can earn the respect or I know what I think Kate wants or what I think people in church want just like there's all this subconscious stuff that I don't recognize or don't realize or don't want to face and so those things run me and I don't live that way anymore I want to be intentional I want to run my own life I want to like craft my own life with Kate and for our kids anyway in group I was kind of talking about some of the stuff that I've been going through this week and just a couple of like highlights out of that meeting one Micaiah asked me why I think I chose now to stop refilling my anxiety meds and he asked because I told him those you know my two different anxiety meds ran out and I decided not to fill them and he was just curious like I wonder if it like the you know the addict in you sees all this other stuff going on in your life but like the good steps you're making and getting rid of your like the control of your addiction and so that side of you decided to not fill the prescriptions to add a little more chaos in the hopes of like tipping the scales in favor of abandoning the gentle path and going for pornography the second highlight from the meeting was I got to show them my sketches that I've been doing this week during my journaling times and it was just really cool because I could I could tell they're both really impacted by it they both were really just kind Micaiah teared up when he was looking at them which made me feel really loved I just felt really seen and I got to tell him like I was really proud of like the style of them and they both were just genuinely really happy for me and really impacted by the pieces so just it felt good to be known and seen like that the third thing is that Parker mentioned as I was sharing all the stuff you know just I seem like I was being really down on myself but he actually kind of locked eyes with Micaiah several times and they both just kind of had this look about them like man that's that's so Zach like that's like that's this really beautiful thing about him yeah there's like he's talking about it in the context of like this way that he feels like he made a mistake or messed up or whatever but man the fact that he's so aware about these things and the fact that he's trying these things it's so it's so cool so that that felt really loving and then the fourth thing is that Parker pointed out I have a plan a really good plan so in my calendar I've got you know homework in the mornings and journaling in the evenings and I've got alarm set so I go to bed on time so I can get up on time and so I've got all this stuff in place but I'm not working the plan and often look it up because I feel like I'm gonna mess it up right now but he courted I guess this like old 12-step like motto and it's something effective you need to make the plan and then work the plan and work the plan because you're worth it so the idea is that I am worth doing these things for myself I'm valuable enough to be taken care of and have my needs met and have my health prioritized and emotional health prioritized so I really want to find ways to incorporate that concept more into my life because I really want to grok it and I just don't feel like I do right now I feel like there's so many like roots of that lie still buried inside of my subconscious that you know I'm not I'm not valuable I'm not worth doing these things for so I want to find ways to like root out those lies and replace them with the truth.
