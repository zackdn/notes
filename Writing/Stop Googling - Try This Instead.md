I'm perplexed I never used this app before...

Ok, so I'm going to start this post off with a little vulnerability. Safe space, ok? Here are the things I've searched online for in the past week.

Lots of questions, right? I'm not alone in this. Many search engines have started scraping the answers to these types of questions from their top results.

## A Better way…

This workflow can feel tedious and I wondered if AI could provide a better alternative. Here's what it looks like in [Claude](https://claude.ai/) and [ChatGPT 3.5](https://chat.openai.com/).

Pretty cool, right? It's quick, it's fun, and it's AI so you just automatically feel sexier as a person. Win, win, win.

After using these flows for a while I found myself wanting to see the sources and double check things. Unfortunately, these tools don't really support that.

## Sources

But I knew of another manifestation of ChatGPT that does: [Bing Chat](https://www.bing.com/chat)! I've played with this tool in the past, but mainly because Microsoft has it plastered all over anything Bing-related online. It's a cool idea, but it's a constant distraction on the Bing search results pages and I've found myself hating it merely on principle. That's not a good reason and I admit I have a problem. I'm working with my therapist on it.

Here's a better reason: as I was testing it I ran out of thread messages and I didn't want to have to use a tool that regularly purged my history.
