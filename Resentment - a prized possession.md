> I wonder at times if these resentments arenâ€™t my most valuable possessions, because I can hold onto them even when I lose many other valuable relationships or possessions.

Resentment is like an old friend to me that provides 1) endless excuses for my no-longer-helpful coping mechanisms and 2) blinders to keep me from seeing the freedom behind forgiveness.
